## What is MailMyBallot.org?

In the midst of pandemic, voters are clamoring for Vote by Mail (VBM) but signing up remains a challenge. [MailMyBallot.org](https://MailMyBallot.org) streamlines and digitizes the government VBM-signup process for voters.  The (**free**) website is a platform to help organizers drive turnout by signing up voters. 

When a voter arrives, MailMyBallot.org does three things:

1. Provides a simple webflow for the voter to sign up for VBM.  The site looks up the appropriate local elections official and prompts the voter to provide state-specific information required for VBM signup.
1. Immediately sends an email or fax directly to the local elections official with the required information entered by the user.
1. Saves the voter contact information for the organizers to follow up once VBM ballots are mailed.

MailMyBallot.org is a website and can be used as a landing page for digital ads or other forms of digital canvassing.

## FAQ for Elections Officials

### How do I provide feedback as an Elections Official?

We are very excited to get feedback from elections officials and want to build tools to make it easier for them to use MailMyBallot.org.  Elections officials can email elections@mailmyballot.org to provide feedback or ask questions.  This email is included in every VBM signup email and fax that goes out to encourage communication with elections officials.
